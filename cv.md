### ___About Me___
Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
***
### __Skills__ 
(e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
***
### __Code examples__
***
### __Experience__ (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)

### ___Education___
***
#### __English__
* I started learning English in high school and continued in college.
* When I was 28 years old, I started learning English with a tutor. I studied English for 8 months and reached A2-B1 level. 
* Then I studied with a new tutor for about 6 months in 2021-2022.
* Then I attended "Cambridge School of English" courses for 4 months and reached B2 level.
* Now I have a good habit - I watch movies and YouTube in English. Also, I read articles on the Internet in English and try to practice English when I can.
