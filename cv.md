### ___About Me___
I got my first computer when I was 6 years old. My whole life has been about computers since I was a kid. My father was an engineer and I studied to be an electronics technician. 

In 6th grade I was given a CD with programming at my own request, but then, unfortunately, I could not start programming. After that I had a few more attempts in my adult life and again unsuccessfully. Now, when many years have passed, I am sure that I am ready to make my wish come true. 

Now I have enough life experience, as well as experience in IT: Community/Project Management for about 6 years. I am still young and full of energy and now I'm ready to become a developer and fulfill my old dream. For starters, Frontend, and then - who knows what it will end up!

### __Experience__ 
* __Frontend__

I started learning HTML\CSS\JavaScript\PHP in 2019 by myself studying popular sites like htmlbook.ru, www.w3schools.com, etc. Developed my own news site on Wordpress, sometimes finalizing the visual and internal parts of the site. The site lasted almost a year, after which I abandoned it. Completely managed to pass and repeat one of the video courses and make up the site by the [example](https://bit.ly/3T73jEA). Also made with 10 small sites in pure HTML\CSS for training. 
Worked a bit with PHP\SQL\OpenServer as I had to finalize my site on Wordpress.

Worked as Project Manager at a [small website development company](https://leadme.agency/) for about six months. Mainly the sites were web-sites as a landing page. Had to interact with programmers, designers and other specialists, so I understand the process of creating such sites.

* __Other skills__
1. Completed software testing courses in 2015. 
2. In 2017, about a month to learn how to work in the programming language "__C__" intensive. Couldn't finish because the training company itself started having problems. 
3. Studied Assembler, Visual Basic, Delphi and others at сollege.
